# Shredcaster

"Shredcaster is a lightweight utility that lets any Solana full node (validator, RPC, or Mithril verifying node) forward Turbine (TVU) packets to arbitrary UDP listeners. Compared to existing open-source solutions, it offers several key improvements, including:

## Proposed Architecture

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor RL as Remote Listener
    participant NIC

    box rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.2) User Space
    participant V as Validator
    participant SF as shred-forwarder
    end
    box rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.2) Kernel Space
    participant XP as XDP Probe
    participant TC as Traffic Control Probe
    participant KN as Kernel Netstack
    end

    NIC -) XP: Incoming Packet
    Note over SF,XP: Packet is a shred if:<br>1. is a UDP Packet<br>2. Matches Turbine Port<br>3. Payload Length <= 1232
    alt If packet is a shred
        rect rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.2)
        XP -) SF: Copied Packet
        Note over XP,SF: Shared Memory(UMEM) Ring Buffer
        end
        XP ->> KN: Packet
        Note over XP,KN: XDP_PASS
        KN ->> V: Packet
    else Normal Packet Flow
        XP ->> KN: Packet
        Note over XP,KN: XDP_PASS
    end

    V -) KN: Egress Packet
    KN ->> TC: Egress Packet
    alt If packet is a shred
        rect rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.2)
        TC -) SF: Copied Packet
        Note Over TC,SF: Shared Memory (UMEM) Ring Buffer
        end
    end
    TC -->> KN: Egress Packet
    KN ->> NIC: Egress Packet

    loop For each listener
        rect rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.2)
        SF -) NIC: Modified Packet
        Note over SF, NIC: shred-forwarder modifies Ethernet, IPv4, UDP header<br> Sent via AF_XDP
        end
        NIC -) RL: Modified Packet
    end
```


## Compilation

[bpf-linker](https://github.com/aya-rs/bpf-linker) is required to compile the BPF probe which monitors TVU traffic.

```bash
cargo build --release -p shred-forwarder
```

## Running

Elevated privileges are required to run `shred-forwarder`

To view the help menu:
```bash
sudo ./target/release/shred-forwarder --help
```


Example:

```
sudo ./target/release/shred-forwarder --tvu-ports 9000 --iface eth0 --listeners 127.0.0.1:5000
```

This will monitor incoming turbine packets on UDP port 9000 and interface `eth0`, and forward this traffic to a UDP socket running on `127.0.0.1:5000`

Multiple listeners are supported
```
--listeners 127.0.0.1:5000 --listeners 127.0.0.1:5001
```

Listener can also be a remote address.

Multiple TVU ports are also supported


## Monitoring

Watching TVU broadcast is currently work in progress. It can be enabled with the `--watch-egress` flag
